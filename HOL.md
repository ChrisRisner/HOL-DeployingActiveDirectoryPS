# Deploy Active Directory in Windows Azure using PowerShell#

---
<a name="Overview" /></a>
## Overview ##

In this lab, you will provision a newly created Windows Server 2012 Virtual Machine called DC01 in Windows Azure using the Windows Azure PowerShell Cmdlets and then deploy Active Directory using Server Manager on DC01. DC01 will be the first domain controller in a new forest.

When deploying Active Directory in Windows Azure, two aspects are important to point out.

The first one is the networking configuration. Domain members and domain controllers need to find the DNS server hosting the domain DNS information. You will use the Azure network configuration, to set up the DNS service.

Secondly, it is important to prevent Active Directory database corruption. Active Directory assumes that it can write its database updates directly to disk. That means that you should place the Active Directory database files on a data disk that does not have write caching enabled.

### Getting Started: Obtaining Subscription's Credentials ###

In order to complete this lab, you will need your subscription’s secure credentials. Windows Azure lets you download a Publish Settings file with all the information required to manage your account in your development environment.

<a name='GSTask1' /></a>
#### Task 1 - Downloading and Importing a Publish Settings file ####

> **Note:** If you have done these steps in a previous lab on the same computer you can move on to Exercise 1.


In this task, you will log on to the Windows Azure Portal and download the Publish Settings file. This file contains the secure credentials and additional information about your Windows Azure Subscription that you will use in your development environment. Therefore, you will import this file using the Windows Azure Cmdlets in order to install the certificate and obtain the account information.

1.	Open Internet Explorer and browse to <https://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx>.

1.	Sign in using the **Microsoft Account** associated with your **Windows Azure** account.

1.	**Save** the Publish Settings file to your local file system.

	![Downloading publish-settings file](Images/downloading-publish-settings-file.png?raw=true 'Downloading publish-settings file')

	_Downloading Publish Settings file_

	> **Note:** The download page shows you how to import the Publish Settings file using the Visual Studio Publish box. This lab will show you how to import it using the Windows Azure PowerShell Cmdlets instead.

1. Search for **Windows Azure PowerShell** in the Start screen and choose **Run as Administrator**.

1.	Change the PowerShell execution policy to **RemoteSigned**. When asked to confirm press **Y** and then **Enter**.
	
	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
	````

	> **Note:** The Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet enables you to determine which Windows PowerShell scripts (if any) will be allowed to run on your computer. Windows PowerShell has four different execution policies:
	>
	> - _Restricted_ - No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
	> - _AllSigned_ - Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
	> - _RemoteSigned_ - Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
	> - _Unrestricted_ - No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.
	>
	> For more information about Execution Policies refer to this TechNet article: <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx>


1.	The following script imports your Publish Settings file and generates an XML file with your account information. You will use these values during the lab to manage your Windows Azure Subscription. Replace the placeholder with the path to your Publish Setting file and execute the script.

	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile '[YOUR-PUBLISH-SETTINGS-PATH]'   
	````

1. Execute the following commands and take note of the Subscription name and the storage account name you will use for the exercise.

	<!-- mark:1-3 -->
	````PowerShell
	Get-AzureSubscription | select SubscriptionName
	Get-AzureStorageAccount | select StorageAccountName 
	````

1. If the preceding command do NOT return a storage account, you should create one first.
  
	1. Run the following command to determine the data center to create your storage account in. Ensure you pick a data center that shows support for PersistentVMRole. 

		````PowerShell
		Get-AzureLocation  
		````

	1. Create your storage account: 


		````PowerShell
		New-AzureStorageAccount -StorageAccountName '[YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT]' -Location '[DC-LOCATION]'
		````

1. Execute the following command to set your current storage account for your subscription.

	<!-- mark:1 -->
	````PowerShell
	Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName '[YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-NAME]' -CurrentStorageAccount '[YOUR-STORAGE-ACCOUNT]'
	````

## Exercises ##

This hands-on lab includes the following exercises:

1. [Add a new data disk to the virtual machine](#Exercise1)
1. [Deploy a new domain controller in Windows Server 2012](#Exercise2)

<a name="Exercise1" /></a>
### Exercise 1: Add a new data disk to the virtual machine ###

You will now modify the virtual machine you already created from the "Provisioning a Windows Azure Virtual Machine (PowerShell)" lab. We will call this VM DC01. We will create and provision a data disk to this existing VM which will be used in exercise 2 to place the AD database files.

Exercise 1 contains 2 tasks:

1. Attach a data disk to DC01
1. Configure a new data disk on DC01

<a name="Ex1Task1" /></a>
#### Task 1 - Attach a data disk to DC01####

1. Start **Windows Azure PowerShell**.

1. Run the following command to add a data disk to the existing virtual machine. Make sure you replace the plaholder accordingly, using the service name you provided when creating the virtual machine.

	````PowerShell
	$cloudSvcName = '[YOUR-SERVICE-NAME]'
	$vmname = 'DC01'

	Get-AzureVM -Name $vmname -ServiceName $cloudSvcName |
		Add-AzureDataDisk -CreateNew -DiskSizeInGB 10 -DiskLabel 'DC01-data' -HostCaching 'None' -LUN 0 |
		Update-AzureVM 
	````

	>**Note:** Notice the HostCaching option set to None. For use with the Active Directory database files, we need to use a data disk without caching. 

	![Adding data disk](./Images/add-data-disk.png?raw=true "Adding data disk")

	_Adding data disk_

<a name="Ex1Task2" /></a>
#### Task 2 - Configure a new data disk on DC01####

1. Go to the **Virtual Machines** page within the Windows Azure Management portal and select the Virtual Machine you created by following the _Provisioning a Windows Azure Virtual Machine (PowerShell)_ HOL.

1. Click on the Virtual Machine name to open its page and click on **Dashboard**. Locate and take note of the DNS.

	![Virtual Machine DNS](Images/virtual-machine-dns.png?raw=true)

	_Virtual Machine DNS_

1.  Now click on **Endpoints** and take note of the public port in the remote PowerShell endpoint that was created when you provisioned the virtual machine.

	![Virtual Machine Endpoints](Images/virtual-machine-endpoints.png?raw=true)

	_Virtual Machine Endpoints_

1. In Windows Azure PowerShell, type the following command to access remotely to the virtual machine. Replace [YOUR-VM-DNS] and [YOUR-ENDPOINT-PORT] placeholders with the values obtained in the previous steps. Replace [YOUR-VM-USERNAME] with the administrator username provided when you created the virtual machine.

	````PowerShell
	Enter-PSSession -ComputerName '[YOUR-VM-DNS]' -Port [YOUR-ENDPOINT-PORT] -Authentication Negotiate -Credential '[YOUR-VM-USERNAME]' -UseSSL -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck)
	````
	>**Note:** When prompted, login with the administrator password.

1. You should now be at a prompt with the host name to the left.

1. Type the following command to list the available disks in the virtual machine and take note of the Number of the disk you added in the previous task.

	>**Note:** You can identify the disk you added through the size, 10 GB, and the partition style listed as RAW.

	````PowerShell
	Get-Disk
	````

	![Get-Disk Cmdlet Output](Images/get-disk-cmdlet-output.png?raw=true)

	_Get-Disk Cmdlet Output_

1. Type the following command to initialize the disk. This will allow the creation of a partition and volume. Make sure to replace [YOUR-DISK-NUMBER] with the disk number you got in the previous step.

	````PowerShell
	Initialize-Disk -Number [YOUR-DISK-NUMBER] -PartitionStyle MBR
	````

	>**Note:** After the command executes, type again _Get-Disk_. You will see the disk partition style now listed as MBR.

	![Initialize-Disk Cmdlet Output](Images/initialize-disk-cmdlet-output.png?raw=true)

	_Initialize-Disk Cmdlet Output_

1. Now you need to create a new partition on the initialized disk and then format the volume. To do this, type the following command. Make sure to replace [YOUR-DISK-NUMBER] with the disk number you got in step 6. When asked for confirmation, type Y to continue.

	````PowerShell
	New-Partition -DiskNumber [YOUR-DISK-NUMBER] -UseMaximumSize -DriveLetter 'F' | 
      Format-Volume -NewFileSystemLabel "AD DS Data" -FileSystem NTFS
	````

	>**Note:** This command will create a new partition on the disk, assigning the drive letter F and using the whole space available. Then, it will format a volume on the newly created partition using NTFS file system.

	![New-Partition Cmdlet Output](Images/new-partition-cmdlet-output.png?raw=true)

### Exercise 2: Deploy a new domain controller in Windows Server 2012 ###
You have just created a base virtual machine called DC01, attached the necessary data disk, and provisioned the disk. We are going to login to DC01 to install and configure active directory and then verify the install was successful.

Exercise 2 contains 3 tasks:

1. Install the Active Directory Domain Services Role 
1. Configure the Active Directory Domain Services Role
1. Verify the Domain Controller Installed Successfully

<a name="Ex2Task1" /></a>
#### Task 1 - Install the Active Directory Domain Services Role ####

1. In the **Virtual Machines** section of the Windows Azure portal, select the **DC01** virtual machine, and then on the toolbar, click the **Connect** icon to connect using **Remote Desktop Connection**.

	![Connecting to the DC01 VM](./Images/connecting-to-the-dc01-vm.png?raw=true "Connecting to the DC01 VM")

	_Connecting to the DC01 virtual machine_

1. Open the DC01.rdp file, and connect to the virtual machine.

	>**Note:** use the credentials that you inserted when creating the virtual machine.

1. Inside the remote desktop connection to DC01, open a PowerShell window, and type the following command:

	````PowerShell
	Add-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services  -IncludeManagementTools
	````

	![Adding the AD feature](./Images/adding-the-ad-feature.png?raw=true "Adding the AD feature")

	_Windows is installing the Active Directory Domain Services role_

<a name="Ex2Task2" /></a>
#### Task 2 - Configure the Active Directory Domain Services Role ####
1. When the feature installation is completed, type the following single command to promote the domain controller:

	````PowerShell
	Install-ADDSForest  -DomainName "contoso.com" -InstallDns:$true  -DatabasePath "F:\NTDS"  -LogPath "F:\NTDS"  -SysvolPath "F:\SYSVOL"  -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false  -Force:$true
	````

	>**Note:** The C: disk is the OS disk, and has caching enabled. The Active Directory database should not be stored on a disk that has write caching enabled. The F: disk is the data disk that we added earlier, and does not have this feature enabled.

	![Promoting the domain controller with powershell ](./Images/promoting-the-domain-controller-with-powershell.png?raw=true "Promoting the domain controller with powershell")

1. At the **SafeModeAdministratorPassword** prompt and the **Confirm SafeModeAdministratorPassword** prompt, type **Passw0rd!**, and then press **Enter**. 

	>**Note:** The computer is promoted to domain controller. After a few moments, the DC01 Virtual Machine will restart. You will lose the connection to the restarting Virtual Machine.

	![Configuring the administrator password](./Images/configuring-the-administrator-password.png?raw=true "Configuring the administrator password")

	_Configuring the administrator password_
